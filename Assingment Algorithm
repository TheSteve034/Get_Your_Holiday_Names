The following algorithm is desgined to meet the following requirements.
    1. No one gives gifts to the a member of the same family.
    2. Each person gets exactly one gift.

It DOES NOT guarantee is the follow:
    1. that a person who gives to another person does get a gift from that person.

Algorithm:
for each f in families{
	for each m in f{
		randomly select family from available famililes called sF where count of sF.sM.isGifted = False > 0 
		randomly select member from sF called sM where sM.isGifted = False
		m.GiveTo = sM
		sM.isGifted = True
    }
}
